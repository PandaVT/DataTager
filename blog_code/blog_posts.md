Since the provided details do not contain any blog posts in the conventional sense (i.e., no blog post titles and hyperlinks within the `<body>` section), we have to structure the available data accordingly. Here’s a JSON representation based on the given information:

```json
{
  "webpageTitle": "DataTager",
  "links": {
    "favicon": {
      "url": "/æ .ico",
      "type": "image/svg+xml"
    },
    "scripts": [
      {
        "name": "Google Tag Manager",
        "url": "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-8C3YJZQ7XN"
      },
      {
        "name": "Microsoft Clarity Script",
        "url": "https://www.clarity.ms/tag/m08h712db3"
      },
      {
        "name": "Module Script",
        "url": "/assets/index-6445a63e.js"
      }
    ],
    "stylesheet": {
      "url": "/assets/index-6910887f.css"
    }
  }
}
```
